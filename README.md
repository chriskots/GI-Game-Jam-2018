# GI-Game-Jam-2018
Me and 3 others created a side scroller game that implemented flying and digging to finish the level and proceed to the next stage. The final game is not provided provided because it is more than 25mb but the scrips used for players and enemies are provided. This game was made on the Unity Game Engine.
